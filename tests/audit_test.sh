# tests/audit_test.sh - phil/audit against a live audit log (auditfs):
# a reading phil/read kept, and the reading phil/argue kept from three,
# are backed by their sealed records; a comment added changes nothing;
# a statement changed, or a reading written by hand under a provenance
# line, is unbacked, and audit fails; a reader that tries to seal a
# record of its own cannot reach the log; the chain verifies.  ROOT as
# for tests/run.sh; WWB, the Writer's Workbench, by default beside this
# tree.
